						<h2>Make It Mobile: The Importance of Finger-Friendly Web Design</h2>
						<p>“Hang on. Let me look it up on my phone.”<br><br>
						How many times have you heard some variation of that phrase in the past half-decade? From friends or family during civil debates, or from colleagues and clients in morning meetings, or even from strangers you walk past and overhear on the street.<br><br>
						Heck, <em>you’ve</em> probably said it more times than you can remember in the past few months alone!</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class='img-wrap'><img src='img/usingphone.gif' alt='using mobile phone' class='img-responsive'></div>
					<br>
					
					<div class="blog_inner_head"><p>Just think about it...<br><br> Whether it’s a quick fact-check or a full browse-and-buy session, how we consume information on our phones has evolved significantly. Long gone are the days when they were simply used for talk or text, and – if lucky enough – the occasional browsing on a tiny screen at crawling speeds.
					<br><br>
					We’ve reached a new era with regards to the roles our phones play in our browsing habits. Make no mistake: in this digital day and age, mobile is the dominant device.</p></div>
					
					<div class="blog_inner_head">
						<h2>Mobile in the Modern Web</h2>
						<p>For those of you thinking that this market still has a lot of growing to do, here’s a quick statistic that should lead you to reconsider.<br><br>
						According to independent web analytics company <a href="http://statcounter.com/" target="_blank">StatCounter</a>:</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="blog_inner_blue">
					<p><em>“Mobile and tablet internet usage exceeds desktop worldwide for the first time (in October 2016)”</em></p>
					</div>
				
					<div class='img-wrap'><img src="img/internet_usage_2016.png" alt="internet usage stats 2016" class='img-responsive'></div><br>
					
					<div class="blog_inner_head">
						<p>And while the article does go on to acknowledge that “desktop is still the primary mode of internet usage in mature markets such as the US and UK,” it doesn’t discount the fact that <strong>web usage as a whole is shifting towards a mobile-first approach.</strong></p>
											
						<p>
						Are we at a point where desktops are extinct? Not even close.<br><br>
						<strong>But, how users surf the web on their phones is not the same as how they do from their desktop.</strong></p>
						
						<div class='img-wrap'><img src="img/responsive_design.gif" alt="responsive design" class='img-responsive'></div><br>
						
						<p>For instance, if you were hungry, you might look up local restaurants on your phone, get directions, look at the menu, maybe call for a reservation or even download a coupon. <br><br> <em>The easier it is for you to do these things -- and the more natural an interaction it feels -- then the more likely you are to become an engaged customer.</em></p>
					</div>	
						
					<div class="blog_inner_blue">
					<p><em>“88% of consumers who search for a type of local business on a mobile device call or go to that business within 24 hours.”<a href="http://nectafy.com/mobile-marketing-trends-mash-up/" target="_blank"> (Source: Nectafy)</a></em></p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="blog_inner_head">
						<p>Have you ever tried to highlight a phone number to copy and paste it into your dialer screen? Or fumble around, looking for pen and paper? Imagine how many visitors wouldn’t even bother and simply move along to your competitor’s site. The most reasonable solution is to have a simple, one-touch call button on your mobile site to make it easier for the visitor to connect with you. <br><br>
						
						Traditionally, in order to produce this seamless user experience you would have to hand this project to a developer. This simple task will take time and money depending on the complexity of your site.<br><br>

						Or, you can use an overlay tool such as the one developed by us here at Aiva Labs. You don’t need to know any code and that magical tap-to-call button can be created and deployed to your site within minutes allowing visitors to “Call Now” with one touch.<br><br>
						
						Now that’s what finger-friendly design is all about! </p>

					<h2>Mobile By The Numbers</h2>
						<p>Okay, back to the figures.<br><br>Let's look at just a few stats that make a seriously convincing case for a mobile-first marketing strategy:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Average smartphone conversion rates are up 64%</strong> compared to the average desktop conversion rates. <a href="https://cmsreport.com/articles/the-5-mobile-marketing-mistakes-infographic-14849" target="_blank">(Source: CMS Report)</a></li>
								<li>Mobile offers are redeemed <strong>10x more frequently</strong> than print offers. <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Spurs-Digital-Coupon-User-Growth/1009639#4sjDzjbE9S6hDWYA.99" target="_blank">(Source: eMarketer)</a></li>
								<li><strong>Over 50% of all mobile searches lead to a purchase.</strong> <a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/mobile/7-mobile-marketing-stats-that-will-blow-your-mind/" target="_blank"> (Source: Convince and Convert)</a> </li>
								<li><strong>4 out of 5 consumers</strong> use smartphones to shop. <a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/mobile/7-mobile-marketing-stats-that-will-blow-your-mind/" target="_blank">(Source: Convince and Convert)</a> </li>
							</ul><br>
						<p>These are just a few key takeaways from the numerous studies constantly being conducted. All of the data has shown that mobile marketing is profitable and shouldn't be ignored.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="blog_inner_blue">
					<p><em>“68% of companies have integrated mobile marketing into their overall marketing strategy.” <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2015/01/2015-state-of-marketing.html" target="_blank">(Source: Salesforce)</a></em></p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="blog_inner_head">
					<p>This is why we, as marketers, should already be pushing and prioritizing a finger-friendly approach. I know it sounds redundant, but having a responsive website is no longer an option - it's a requirement.</p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="blog_inner_head">
					<h2>Mobilize a Plan of Action</h2>
						<p>All of this data and knowledge of trends is great, but if you feel like your business has fallen behind and catching up will be a behemoth of a task, let’s talk about where you can start.<br><br>First, Google offers a simple <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly" target="_blank">mobile-friendly test</a> to help determine if your website is functional on a phone, with insights and recommendations on what to fix if it isn’t.<br><br>If there’s work to be done, <strong>start doing it as soon as possible.</strong> Connect with your designers and developers and have them hash out the best approach to ensuring you’re thinking fingers first.<br><br>In most cases, the best solution will likely be the one that we use here at Aiva Labs: responsive design. As we mentioned, this simply means that a website’s content will adapt to the specific device with which a user is browsing. But as with all things web, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, and your team will likely need to talk it over for a while before the work begins.</p></div>
						
						<div class='img-wrap'><img src="img/responsiveness.gif" alt="responsive design" class='img-responsive'></div><br>
						
						<div class="blog_inner_head">
						<p>The next important step is to stick with a mobile-first mindset from here on out.<br><br>Starting with whatever revamps are needed, everything you do in the digital landscape - every new piece of content, every new email campaign, every form of customer outreach - <strong>should be done with mobile at top of mind.</strong><br><br>Because it’s time to face the facts: this is no longer a tomorrow project.<br><br>If you’re not prioritizing finger-friendly functionality and design across all of your online marketing materials, you’re alienating a huge - and likely growing - chunk of your audience. It’s that simple.</p>
						</div>

					<div class="blog_inner_head">
					<h2>Make Your Marketing Mobile-Friendly</h2>
						<p>Now that you’ve made the switch to mobile-first, you may still have some concerns with regards to the delivery of your marketing content. After all, <strong>mobile responsiveness doesn’t necessarily increase conversions.</strong><br><br>It’s important to understand that responsive design is also about providing a fluid user experience.
